 /* SQL set theory!

Union: like union in math 
Union all: includes all of both tables, which double counts

Intersect: like intersect in math
Except: like a subset in math, excludes a subset of the table *\

/* When intersect looks at two columns, it includes both columns in the search. 
It looks for *records* in common, not individual key fields like what a join does to match. *\
